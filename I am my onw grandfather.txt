I married a widow who has an adult daughter. My father, who very often visited us, fell in love with my stepdaughter and married her. Therefore, my father became my son-in-law, and my stepdaughter became my stepmother. A few months later, my wife gave birth to a son who became a brother-in-law (son-in-law) to my father, and therefore my uncle. My father's wife, i.e. My stepdaughter, also gave birth to a       son.
I am my own granfather?
